Introduction to FLBF
=====================

This foundation aims to consider the whole of living beings as individuals. In order to reach this philosophy of thought, the foundation proposes a set of licenses based originally on free licenses and fitted to physical persons as well as moral ones having a link with animals. The foundation's community contributes actively to share this spirit.
